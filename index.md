## Life at eToro Labs
<div class="row">
  <div class="col-sm-6">
    <p>  
      We are seeking senior software engineers to join our small team of software developers in Copenhagen. We are a diverse team with different backgrounds, some of us have an academic specialization at the level of a masterâ€™s degree, Ph.D. and Postdoc - others are experienced in product development or work as full stack developers.
    </p>
    <p>
      You will work primarily out of the danish offices in Copenhagen, based on the South Campus of the University of Copenhagen (KUA). We offer a high degree of flexibility in terms of hybrid work.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have a relaxed and informal office atmosphere and believe that task-ownership and intrinsic motivation is key, in producing superior products. We work primarily on a project-oriented basis in which we value clear and transparent communication. For this reason, we appreciate applicants who are ready and capable to take initiative and end-to-end responsibility.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="col-sm-6">
    <p>
      Due to the innovative and research-based nature of our work, you will work side-by-side with software developers, product managers and academics and produce solutions at the bleeding edge of financial technologies. Our work covers a wide range of topics, from building and supporting the integration of institutional trading infrastructure to designing and deploying novel DeFi architecture. Working at eToro Labs tends to be research intensive and thus requires the ability to absorb and apply large quantities of new knowledge, while occasionally running fast towards ambitious deadlines.
    </p>
    <p>
      We are closely connected to the Department of Computer Science at the University of Copenhagen, ITU and Copenhagen Business School and occasionally publish the results of our work in leading journals and conference proceedings. If you have considered a PhD, Postdoc or similar research position in the area of distributed financial architecture, decentralized financial applications or the equivalent, we are happy to help you towards this goal. For eligible candidates, we have the opportunity to apply for an industrial PhD or Postdoc program as an extension of your employment, through which you will gain academic credentials while carrying out your work at eToro Labs.
